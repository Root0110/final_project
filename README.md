**Discover the distribution of social wealth with the use of Monte Carlo Simulations Method**   
By Xiaohan Wang

## Project Background
The Monte Carlo simulation involves running many scenarios with different random inputs and summarizing the distribution of the results from potential result. This distribution can inform the likelihood that the result will be within a certain window. 

Many researchers are devoted to design a set of rules to maintain relative justice in the society, which matters a lot to all of us. Before that, we need to understand the distribution of the wealth within the whole society, to see how it would be assigned to each individual. And since the amount of money one person earns and donates are two random variables, so I would apply Monte Carlo Simulation method to dive deeply into the distribution of money one person owns. Furthermore, I would love to test whether some strategies about dealing with the social wealth id reasonable or not. 

The policy or law related to personal income played a main role in the change of personal wealth. 

## Hypothesis
I About social wealth distribution 
1. Individuals in the whole society would not obtain material wealth at the same level, which means a portion of people have more wealth than the rest. To be specific, 80% of the social wealth may be owned by the top 20% people.
2. As time goes by, the difference between top 20% wealthy people's wealth and the rest 80% would be greater and greater.
II About relevant policy or law
3. If the income tax rate changes to flat tax, 80% of the social wealth may not be owned by the top 20% people.
