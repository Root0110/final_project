**Discover the distribution and evolution of social wealth (under different situations) with the use of Monte Carlo Simulations Method**

## Project Background
The Monte Carlo simulation involves running many scenarios with different random inputs and summarizing the distribution of the results from potential result. This distribution can inform the likelihood that the result will be within a certain window. 

Many researchers are devoted to design a set of rules to maintain relative justice in the society, which matters a lot to all of us. Before that, we need to understand the distribution of the wealth within the whole society, to see how it would be assigned to each individual. And since the amount of money one person earns and donates are two random variables, so I would apply Monte Carlo Simulation method to dive deeply into the distribution of money one person owns. Furthermore, I would love to test whether some strategies about dealing with the social wealth id reasonable or not. 

The policy or law related to personal income played a main role in the change of personal wealth. 

## Hypothesis
About social wealth distribution    
* Individuals in the whole society would not obtain material wealth at the same level, which means a portion of people have more wealth than the rest. To be specific, 80% of the social wealth may be owned by the top 20% people.
* As time goes by, the difference between top 20% wealthy people's wealth and the rest 80% would be greater and greater.    

About relevant policy or law     
* If the income tax rate changes to flat tax, 80% of the social wealth may not be owned by the top 20% people.

## Project Design  
There are 5 factors that have primary influence in the amount of personal wealth.

1.__"Status Quo" (Intial amount of wealth)__     
It's realistic that some of the social members are born with some assets, like the any kinds of heritage form their ancestors. Since not everyone has uniform amount of assets, so I initialize personal wealth value with random numbers. The __distribution/proportion__ is consistent with xxxxx research/report.

2.__Personal Income__    
Income is the main part in our assets, including stable income like salary from hard work, and unstable income like gains or loss from stock or lottery.  

3.__Tax__   
It's an efficient way for the governemnt to get citizens paying all kinds of tax to be involved in the construction of country. Here I focus on income tax rate. And to simplify the real situation, I made assumption that people with top 50% income should pay x% tax, and it's necessary for the rest.

4.__Social Welfare__   
In modern society, the government feels responsible for providing some welfare for __every__ social member. It can be medical insurance, pension fee, and other kinds of life guarantee. This is a kind of stable addition to personal wealth, and it's not distinguishing between the poor and the rich.

5.__Other Possible Accidents__  
illness or?? bankrupt


Based on the above five factor, I build ? models representing countries under different situations(parameters).
* __Country A__   
* __Country B__   
* __Country C__   


Maybe there're some connections/interations among them.
